RPN Calulator wrttien in Ruby that runs the four basic arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/). I chose to write the application in Ruby, because I am very comfortable with Ruby and running Ruby code in the console runs smoothly and is easy to test.

If I had more time, I would include: more tests revolving the input of each operation, more operations, the ability to enter the equations differently(ie multiple lines), and spec out the methods instead of two methods.
